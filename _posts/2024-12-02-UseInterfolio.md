# How to Use Interfolio to Forward Recommendation Letters  

Interfolio is an excellent platform for requesting, storing, and forwarding recommendation letters from advisors, mentors, and peers. With Interfolio, you can request a letter once and use it for multiple applications without repeatedly asking your recommenders to upload the same letter. You can directly upload the same letter with the same application system for free, for other application system, you need to upgrade first
and use the delivery functionality ($59.99/year).

## How It Works  

1. **Request Once, Use Multiple Times**  
   After requesting a recommendation letter and having your advisor upload it to Interfolio, you will receive a unique email address for that letter (ending in `@interfoliodossier.com`). This email can be used in various application systems, allowing you to forward the same letter without bothering your recommender again.  

2. **Streamlined Process**  
   Instead of uploading a new copy for every application, your recommenders only need to upload the letter once. You can then use Interfolio to manage and forward it to multiple institutions seamlessly.

   Navigate to **Deliveries** → **New Delivery**, selecting the letter that you want interfolio to deliver, you’ll find a unique email address associated with the letter. Copy this email address (it ends with `@interfoliodossier.com`) to the application system of the target university and then click contiue in the interfolio. 

5. **Use the Email Address for Applications**  
   When completing applications on other platforms, enter this unique email address in the recommendation request field copied from the last step. This will allow the application system to retrieve the letter from Interfolio directly.

## Note  
This process is ideal if you’re using the same letter for multiple applications and do not need your recommender to tailor the letter for specific positions.  

Using Interfolio simplifies the application process and ensures your recommenders won’t need to upload the same document multiple times, saving time and effort for everyone involved.
