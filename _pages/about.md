This is Yizhuo's home on the web! I'm a PhD candidate in UC, Riverside. I'm into all the stuff about computers, especially how operating system works. Coding is the magic for me and I'm keeping improving my ability to wave the wond. 
### My experience in the computer world:
#### Security (C/C++)
* Bug detection via program analysis
* LLVM front end, optimization and back end
* Exploits scripts for vulnerability(CVE-2014-3153)
* CTF style exploits

#### AI/Data Mining/Machine Learning (Python):
* Feature selection 
* Cat/Malware Classifier
* Visualzing the distribution of conference from WikiCFP (http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)


#### Software Development (JAVA):
* Instant message applications
* Android App: Voter

Currently I'm doing the program analysis and system security, I already got my name in the Linux patch work, which increases my confidence. Also my paper is undersubmission of ACM ccs 2020. This is not only my effort but also the team effort from my advisors and collabrators. I appreciate the patience and help they deliver to me and those mean a lot to me.

The feeling to be a PhD is hard to be summarized in one sentence, sometimes struggling, sometimes exciting, but overall this is the best choice I have made in my life.
