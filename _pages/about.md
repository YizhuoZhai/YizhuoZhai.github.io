Welcome to Yizhuo's corner of the web! I'm a postdoc at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with [Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim). I gain my PhD in UC, Riverside, under the guidance of  [Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~krish/) and [Zhiyun Qian](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/). I also tightly collabrate with [Chengyu Song](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~csong/) and [Manu Sridharan](https://manu.sridharan.net). I'm into all the stuff about computers, especially how operating system works. Coding is the magic for me and I'm keeping improving my ability to wave the wand.

### My experience in the computer world:
#### Security (C/C++)
* Bug detection via program analysis in Linux Kernel
* C/C++ sanitizers  
* LLVM frontend, optimization and backend  
* Clang plugin and libclang  
* Exploits scripts for vulnerability(CVE-2014-3153)  
* CTF style exploits  

#### AI/Data Mining/Machine Learning (Python):
* Feature selection 
* Cat/Malware Classifier
* Visualzing the distribution of conference from WikiCFP (http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)


#### Software Development (JAVA):
* Instant message applications
* Android App: Voter

Currently I'm doing the program analysis and system security, I already got my name in the Linux patch work, which increases my confidence. This is not only my effort but also the team effort from my advisors and collabrators. I appreciate the patience and help they deliver to me and those mean a lot to me.

The feeling to be a PhD is hard to be summarized in one sentence, sometimes struggling, sometimes exciting, but overall this is the best choice I have made in my life.
