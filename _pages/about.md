This is Yizhuo's home on the web! I'm a PhD candidate in UC, Riverside and co-advised by [Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~krish/) and [Zhiyun Qian](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/). I'm into all the stuff about computers, especially how operating system works. Coding is the magic for me and I'm keeping improving my ability to wave the wand. 
### News
[08/07/2020]I authored 7 challenges for [Baidu AutoPwn](https://anquan.baidu.com/bctf/#/en/autopwn)
[06/15/2020]I start my summer intern in Baidu X-lab.
[05/19/2020]Our paper "UBITect: A Precise and Scalable Method to Detect Use-Before-Initialization Bugs in Linux Kernel" is accepted by ESEC/FSE 2020.

### My experience in the computer world:
#### Security (C/C++)
* Bug detection via program analysis
* LLVM front end, optimization and back end
* Exploits scripts for vulnerability(CVE-2014-3153)
* CTF style exploits

#### AI/Data Mining/Machine Learning (Python):
* Feature selection 
* Cat/Malware Classifier
* Visualzing the distribution of conference from WikiCFP (http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)


#### Software Development (JAVA):
* Instant message applications
* Android App: Voter

Currently I'm doing the program analysis and system security, I already got my name in the Linux patch work, which increases my confidence. This is not only my effort but also the team effort from my advisors and collabrators. I appreciate the patience and help they deliver to me and those mean a lot to me.

The feeling to be a PhD is hard to be summarized in one sentence, sometimes struggling, sometimes exciting, but overall this is the best choice I have made in my life.
